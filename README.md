# ResponseIm.js

## Inspiration

Front end web development has come a long way. Web pages today contain many utilities and frameworks to make their elements responsive to screen size. However, images on web pages don't have much of any utilities to adjust their content based on screen size. That's why we made ResponsIm.js

## How it works

We use Seam Carving as described by Shai Avidan et al. in their paper Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing [http://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf]

We demonstrated this web capability at Bitcamp 2015 by creating a fake Investor Profiler page using FINRA data, and placing a responsive image of the skyline of London as a banner on the top of the page.
